# Stock-Predictions-Using-LSTM-and-GRU
This project has been done in the context of the Advanced Data Analysis class of HEC Lausanne MScF

All models have been saved by checkpoints. So to predict you do not have to run the whole code.

Data is provided as well and has been pre-processed on DATACLEAN2 and on Predictions to create 14 different dataframes of microstructure for each company
